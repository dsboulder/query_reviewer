# QueryReviewer #

## Introduction ##

QueryReviewer is an advanced SQL query analyzer.  It accomplishes the following goals:

 * View all EXPLAIN output for all SELECT queries to generate a page
 * Rate a page's SQL usage into one of three categories: OK, WARNING, CRITICAL
 * Attach meaningful warnings to individual queries, and collections of queries
 * Display interactive summary on page

## This Fork ##

I use this utility for most of my rails projects. Still the best out there in my opinion for analyzing and understanding your generated SQL queries. I forked the original [query_reviewer](https://github.com/dsboulder/query_reviewer) and applied a collection of patches that have been made since the plugin was created. A list of the biggest additions below:

 * Snazzed up the README into markdown for better readability
 * Full compatibility for Rails 3 (including Railtie)
 * Cleanup and move rake task to `lib/tasks` to fix deprecation warnings
 * Added gemspec for use with Bundler (as a gem)
 * Fixed missing tags and additional XHTML escaping
 * Fix SQL escaping for better XHTML compatibility
 * Fixes for deprecation warnings and for 1.9 compatiblity
 * Converts templates to more modern foo.html.erb naming

Last commit to the main repository was on March 30th, 2009. This fork compiles a variety of patches that were made since that time along with additional work to support compatibility with 1.9 and Rails 3. **Also:** If anyone else creates generally useful enhancements to this utility please start by forking this and then issue me a pull request.

**Note:** This plugin should work for Rails 2.X and Rails 3. Support for Rails 3 has been confirmed in the latest revision (with fixed deprecation warnings).

## Installation ##

All you have to do is install it into your Rails 2 or 3 project.

    gem install query_reviewer

Right now if you use bundler, simply add this to your Gemfile:

    # Gemfile
    gem "query_reviewer", :git => "git://github.com/nesquena/query_reviewer.git"

If you are not using bundler, you might want to [start using it](http://gembundler.com/rails23.html). You can also install this as a plugin:

    script/plugin install git://github.com/nesquena/query_reviewer.git

In Rails 2, the rake tasks are not loaded automatically (as a gem), youâ€™ll need to add the following to your Rakefile:

    # Rakefile
    begin
      require 'query_reviewer/tasks'
    rescue LoadError
      STDERR.puts "The query_reviewer gem could not be found!"
    end

You can then run:

    $ rake query_reviewer:setup

Which will create `config/query_reviewer.yml` in your application, see below for what these options mean.
If you don't create a config file, the gem will use the default in `vendor/plugins/query_reviewer`.

## Configuration ##

The configuration file allows you to set configuration parameters shared across all rails environment, as well as overriding those shared parameteres with environment-specific parameters (such as disabling analysis on production!)

 * `enabled`: whether any output or query analysis is performed.  Set this false in production!
 * `inject_view`: controls whether the output automatically is injected before the &lt;/body&gt; in HTML output.
 * `profiling`: when enabled, runs the MySQL SET PROFILING=1 for queries longer than the `warn_duration_threshold` / 2.0
 * `production_data`: whether the duration of a query should be taken into account
 * `stack_trace_lines`: number of lines of call stack to include in the "short" version of the stack trace
 * `trace_includes_vendor`: whether the "short" verison of the stack trace should include files in /vendor
 * `trace_includes_lib`: whether the "short" verison of the stack trace should include files in /lib
 * `warn_severity`: the severity of problem that merits "WARNING" status
 * `critical_severity`: the severity of problem that merits "CRITICAL" status
 * `warn_query_count`: the number of queries in a single request that merits "WARNING" status
 * `critical_query_count`: the number of queries in a single request that merits "CRITICAL" status
 * `warn_duration_threshold`: how long a query must take in seconds (float) before it's considered "WARNING"
 * `critical_duration_threshold`: how long a query must take in seconds (float) before it's considered "CRITICIAL"

## Example ##

If you disable the inject_view option above, you'll need to manually put the analyzer's output into your view:

    # view.html.haml
    = query_review_output

and that will display the analyzer view!
